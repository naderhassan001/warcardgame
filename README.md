<h1 align="center">War Card Game</h1>

<p align="center">
This card game is the game of War. Basically, the card with highest number wins. Under the word "win" there is a ticker that points to the card with the highest suite. In the bottom of each card, there is an array that keeps track of the history of the cards. The button "next game" will start the game. At the end, there is an alert that will declare either the user or dealer as the winner.
